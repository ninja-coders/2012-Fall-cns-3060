CNS 3060 - Operating System Principles
========

Welcome to the repository for the sample code that will be created and used in the 3060 class.  Since this class will be done in C/C++, the examples will also be in the same language.  Be sure to update (git pull) the code frequently so that you can have access to all the code we have written together in class. 

Contributing
-----------

I am not a perfect coder, and it is very easy to accidentally introduce a bug or other issue in the code (especially in c++ with memory management).  So to help keep the code as correct and clean, the process when you find a bug is to "fork" this repository.  After you have a fork you have access to change the code in that fork, and then you will submit a pull request (and assign it to me michael-wright).  I will review it and then merge the fix back into the code base.  You are encouraged to contribute and will receive extra credit at the end of the semester according to any contributions you make.
