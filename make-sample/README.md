Make Sample
==========

This file is specifically setup to show you how to create a simple make file from a single cpp file.  If you have more then one file, it can be a little more complex, and so it has not been added in this document.

Requirements
------------

In this class you will have 3 requirements that in place when using a make file....

1. You must supply the "make clean" command to remove any artifacts
2. Anything that you build must be ignored by git (added to the .gitignore file)
3. You must supply a "make run" that will run the program, including a set of default arguments if arguments are required.
